Analyze it for:\n- Conversational, mid-conversation tone (no formal greetings unless starting a new thread)\n- Clear paragraph breaks (one idea per paragraph)\n- Short, digestible chunks with appropriate spacing\n- Natural language (sounds like talking to a teammate out loud)\n- NO em dashes (absolute rule - rewrite sentences to flow naturally)\n- Warm but direct communication\n- Appropriate structure and readability\n\nProvide a refined version that matches the style guidelines, and explain any key changes you made. Keep the core meaning and intent intact while making it sound more natural and aligned with the style guides."
