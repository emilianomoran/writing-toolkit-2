# Slack Message Draft

Refine a rough draft Slack message according to style guidelines.

## Usage

Type `/slack-message-draft` in Cursor chat, then provide your rough draft message. The assistant will review it against your Slack style guidelines and help you refine it.

## What It Does

1. Reviews your Slack style documentation:
   - `slack-style.md`
   - `tone-of-voice/slack-style.md`
   - `tone-of-voice/agent-instructions/do-and-dont.md`
   - `tone-of-voice/agent-instructions/formatting-rules.md`

2. Analyzes your rough draft for:
   - Conversational, mid-conversation tone
   - Clear paragraph breaks (one idea per paragraph)
   - Short, digestible chunks
   - Natural language (sounds like talking to a teammate)
   - NO em dashes (absolute rule)
   - Warm but direct communication
   - Appropriate spacing and structure

3. Provides a refined version that matches your style guidelines
