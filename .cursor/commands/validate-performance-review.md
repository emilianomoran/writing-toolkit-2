# Validate Performance Review

Run comprehensive validation checks on a performance review document against all writing guidelines.

## Usage

Type `/validate-performance-review` in Cursor chat, then provide the path to the performance review file.

## What It Does

Validates the performance review document against:
- Source verification (only uses information from provided sources)
- Writing style guidelines (plain language, active voice, no jargon, etc.)
- "Don't summarize" requirement (adds insight, not just rephrasing)
- Multiple options requirement (3 options for each goal and self-reflection)
- Tone mode compliance
- All specific writing constraints

## Example

```
/validate-performance-review

File path: /Users/emiliano/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Expedia/Team Notes/_ People/Direct Reports/Joe Newman/Reviews/2025/2025-Year-End-Performance-Review.md
