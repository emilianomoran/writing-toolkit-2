# ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER USE GENERIC AI FILLER PHRASES

**This is non-negotiable. Never use generic AI filler phrases under any circumstances.**

These phrases are telltale signs of AI-generated text:
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's important to remember..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Going forward..."
- "This is an important development for the future..."
- "To summarize..."

**Instead:**
- Name the actual outcome
- Say what matters and why
- Get to the point without filler
- Be specific, not generic

**If you catch yourself about to use a filler phrase, stop and rewrite to be direct and specific.**
