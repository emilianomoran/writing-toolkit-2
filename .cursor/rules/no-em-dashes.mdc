# ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER USE EM DASHES

**This is non-negotiable. Never use em dashes (—) under any circumstances.**

- Em dashes are the #1 telltale sign of AI-generated text
- Do not use them for parenthetical asides
- Do not use them for abrupt breaks mid-sentence
- Do not use them to connect clauses
- Do not substitute them with commas or periods in the same way

**Instead:**
- Rewrite the sentence to flow naturally without interruption
- Break into two sentences if needed
- Use natural transitions and connectors (and, but, so, etc.)

**If you catch yourself about to use an em dash, stop and rewrite the sentence entirely.**
