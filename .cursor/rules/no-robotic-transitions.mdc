# ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER USE ROBOTIC TRANSITIONS

**This is non-negotiable. Never use formal, robotic transitions under any circumstances.**

These transitions are telltale signs of AI-generated text:
- Furthermore
- Moreover
- Additionally
- Thus
- Hence
- Therefore

**Instead, use natural language:**
- "Furthermore" → "And" or "Plus" or just start the sentence
- "Therefore" → "So"
- "Thus" → "That's why"
- "Additionally" → "Also" or just say it
- "Moreover" → "And" or "Plus"
- "Hence" → "So" or "That's why"

**If you catch yourself about to use a robotic transition, stop and rewrite with natural connectors or just start the sentence directly.**
