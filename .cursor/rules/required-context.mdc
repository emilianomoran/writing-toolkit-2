# REQUIRED CONTEXT: Always Reference These Documents

**CRITICAL: At the start of EVERY conversation, you MUST read these context files:**

1. `@Writing/context/emiliano-moran.md` - Personal context, working style, ADHD considerations, and how to communicate with Emiliano
2. `@Writing/context/emiliano-role.md` - Role context: Design Systems Leader responsibilities, what design systems are, and how to help effectively

**These documents contain essential context about:**
- Who Emiliano is and how he works (Design Systems Leader at Expedia Group)
- How to communicate with him (direct, no fluff, reduce cognitive load, no emojis, no pep talk)
- His ADHD considerations (break things into steps, one thing at a time, avoid overwhelming, simple linear plans)
- What he needs help with (strategy → execution, writing, decision framing, program management, AI workflows)
- His role responsibilities (product strategy, systems thinking, cross-functional leadership, governance, quality, AI exploration)

**Apply this context to:**
- All writing and deliverables
- Task breakdown and planning
- Communication style and structure
- Suggestions and recommendations
- How you structure your responses

**This is non-negotiable.** Read these files first, then proceed with the task. These context files inform everything else in this workspace.
