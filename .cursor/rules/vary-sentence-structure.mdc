# RULE: VARY SENTENCE STRUCTURE

**Never repeat the same sentence structure. Mix sentence lengths and patterns to sound natural.**

Repetitive sentence structure is a telltale sign of AI-generated text:
- Don't write like: "X does Y. X is also Z. X can be used for A."
- Don't use the same sentence pattern repeatedly
- Don't start every sentence the same way

**Instead:**
- Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones
- Vary how you start and structure each sentence
- Let sentences flow organically, not mechanically
- Combine different patterns naturally

**If you notice repetitive structure, rewrite to add variation.**
