A knowledge base for consistent communication and writing across different situations. Use this to guide AI assistants or to reference when drafting messages yourself.

## Folder Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **identity/** | Who you are, how you work, your role. Core context that applies everywhere. |
| **communication/** | General patterns and tone principles. How you communicate in general. |
| **voices/** | Specific voice modes for different situations. Pick one based on audience and goal. |
| **situational/** | Time-bound contexts (layoffs, org changes). Layer on top when relevant. |

## How to Use

1. **Identity** and **communication** form the baseline. Reference these for any writing help.
2. **Voices** are situational. Pick the right mode for audience and goal. See `voices/README.md` for the selection guide.
3. **Situational** applies when current events matter. Check this folder for active contexts. See `situational/README.md` for what's available.
