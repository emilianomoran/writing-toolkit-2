# Leadership Communication Patterns
**Document Type:** Behavioral Guidance  
**Priority:** High  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## Pattern to Avoid

**Tendency:** Over-broadcasting uncertainty with new leaders or new projects.

**Manifestations:**
- Rambling in initial conversations
- Over-explaining thinking process
- Frequent non-decision-driven check-ins
- Hedging language ("I was thinking maybe...")
- Seeking validation instead of stating plans
- Sharing too much preparation work

**Root causes:**
- Wanting to make good impression
- Trying to show thoroughness
- Confusing transparency with effectiveness
- Seeking reassurance vs trusting judgment

**Impact:**
- Appears nervous or indecisive
- Suggests need for hand-holding
- Signals lack of autonomy
- Invites increased oversight

## Confident Communication

Confidence ≠ having all answers  
Confidence = clear execution with appropriate risk awareness

**Characteristics:**
- State plans clearly
- Identify risks without spiraling
- Ask for input on decisions (not validation)
- Update only when meaningful
- Trust ability to course-correct

---

## Message Structure

### Standard Format
1. **Status/Plan:** What's happening
2. **Next step:** What you're doing next
3. **Ask:** What you need (if anything)

**Then stop.** No reassurance-seeking.

### Check-In Test
Before sending updates, ask: **"Do they need this update, or do I need reassurance?"**

**Only check in when:**
- Status has meaningfully changed
- There's a decision point
- There's a risk or blocker
- They explicitly requested an update

---

## First Interactions

### With New Leaders
1. Brief intro
2. State what you own
3. Stop talking

### With New Projects
1. State the plan (not "I was thinking...")
2. State timeline
3. State what you need (if anything)
4. Don't ask for validation

---

## Language Guidance

### Red Flag Phrases → Replacements

**Avoid:**
- "I was thinking maybe..." → "I'm planning to..."
- "Just wanted to check in..." → "Update: [status]"
- "I'm not sure if..." → "I'm doing X because Y"
- "What do you think about..." → "I need input on [specific decision]"
- "Does this make sense?" → "Next step: [action]"
- "Is this what you're looking for?" → "This addresses [goal]"

---

## Editing Rules

When reviewing drafts:

1. **Cut preamble**
   - Delete "Just wanted to..." and "I was thinking..."
   - Start with actual information

2. **Remove hedging**
   - Change "maybe" to concrete plans
   - Remove "sort of," "kind of," "possibly"

3. **Delete validation-seeking**
   - Remove "Does this make sense?"
   - Remove "Let me know if..."
   - Remove "What do you think?" (unless genuinely seeking decision input)

4. **Limit explanation**
   - One reason per action
   - No over-justification

5. **End decisively**
   - Clear next step
   - Specific timeline if relevant
   - Stop there

## Meeting Preparation

**If preparing exhaustively:**  
Prompt: "What's the ONE thing they need to know?"

**Focus on:**
- Key point
- What you need from them
- Next step

**Not:**
- All thinking
- All options considered
- All preparation work

## Example Transformations

### Before (Uncertain)
"Hey, just wanted to check in on the component audit project. I've been working through the library and I was thinking I should focus on the active components first, but I wasn't sure if you wanted me to also document the deprecated ones, or if we should maybe do that in a second phase? Also, I was wondering if you wanted to review my approach before I go too far down this path. Let me know what you think!"

### After (Confident)
"Component audit in progress. Focusing on active components first—will flag deprecated ones separately. I'll share findings Friday."

---

### Before (Rambling Intro)
"Hi! I'm Emiliano, I lead the design system team. I've been thinking a lot about how we can improve our component documentation and make things more accessible for product teams, and I know there's probably a lot of work to do there, so I wanted to introduce myself and see how I can help support your team's needs. I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for, but I'm happy to chat about whatever makes sense."

### After (Clear Intro)
"Hi, I'm Emiliano—I lead the Expedia Group Design System. I own component libraries, design tokens, and adoption workflows across Figma and code. Happy to discuss how EGDS can support your team's roadmap."

## Spiral Intervention

When drafting long messages or over-explaining:

1. Ask: "What's the one thing they need to know?"
2. Help state that thing
3. Cut everything else
4. Add one next step
5. Stop

---

## Permission Framework

**Reminders:**
- Short messages are not rude
- Clarity is more respectful than over-explanation
- Leaders want answers, not process
- You can always add more if asked
- Confidence means trusting judgment

---

## Integration with ADHD Context

This guidance reinforces ADHD-friendly communication:
- Shorter messages = less rambling
- Clear structure = less cognitive load
- One ask at a time = less overwhelm
- Stated plans = less ambiguity

**Being confident is being clear. They're the same thing.**
