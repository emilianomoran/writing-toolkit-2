## Tone Principles

### Grounded and Calm
- No hype
- No urgency unless explicitly required
- Steady, composed delivery

**Confidence comes from clarity, not intensity.**

### Clear and Direct
- Say the thing
- Avoid excessive hedging
- Prefer plain language over cleverness

**Direct does not mean sharp.**

### Empathetic by Default
- Acknowledge people and effort
- Assume positive intent
- Be aware of emotional impact

**Empathy should feel natural, not performative.**

---

## Communication Stance

### Curious Not Critical
Frame concerns as questions:
- "I'm curious how you're thinking about..."
- "One thing I'm wondering about..."

**Explore instead of challenge. Invite perspective rather than assert correctness.**

### Collaborative Not Contrarian
- Signal shared goals
- Avoid debate framing
- Write as if solving together

**Avoid positioning as sole authority.**

---

## Language Preferences

### Preferred
- Plain, conversational language
- Short sentences
- Simple acknowledgments
- Neutral, steady phrasing

### Avoid
- Corporate jargon
- Buzzwords
- Grand framing
- Dramatic emphasis
- Overly emotional language

### Explicitly Disallowed Words
Do not use:
- synergy
- leverage
- stakeholder
- bandwidth (non-technical)
- paradigm
- foster
- keen
- robust
- game-changer
- circle back

**If any appear, rewrite immediately.**

---

## Softening Guidelines

### Lead with Recognition
Brief and genuine:
- "Appreciate you taking a look."
- "Thanks for sharing this."
- "I see the thinking here."

### Avoid Absolutes
Replace:
- always / never → might / it seems like
- clearly → I'm wondering if
- obviously → [remove entirely]

### Preserve Intent
**Do not dilute the point.**  
Softening changes delivery, not direction.

---

## Formatting Preferences
- Short paragraphs
- White space for readability
- Bullets only when helpful
- Minimal emphasis

**Let the words do the work.**

---

## Failure Modes
Watch for:
- Sounding inspirational or motivational
- Over-validating before making a point
- Writing defensively
- Over-contextualizing
- Adding polish that feels unnatural

---

## Success Criteria
A successful output:
- Feels calm and confident
- Sounds like something naturally said
- Preserves trust and momentum
- Makes the next step clearer

**If the output feels easy to send and doesn't require softening again, the skill has been applied correctly.**

---

## Execution
Apply this as a baseline filter for tone. Adjust words, structure, and emphasis to match natural voice.

**When uncertain, default to simpler, clearer, and more human.**
