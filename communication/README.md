General patterns and tone principles that apply across all writing. These sit between identity (who you are) and voices (situation-specific modes).

## How to Call It

Reference when working on any piece of writing:

```
@communication/02-tone-of-voice.md Review this message for tone.
```

```
@communication/01-leadership-patterns.md I'm writing an update to my new manager. Help me structure it.
```

Communication principles apply whenever you use a voice mode. You typically combine `@communication` with `@voices/[mode]` for full context.
