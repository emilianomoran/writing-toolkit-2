**Document Type:** Role-Specific Knowledge  
**Priority:** High  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## What Design Systems Are

A design system is a **productized platform** enabling teams to design, build, and ship consistent, accessible, scalable experiences.

**Components:**
- UI components (Figma + code)
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, motion)
- Patterns and best practices
- Accessibility standards
- Usage guidelines
- Contribution workflows
- Governance and versioning
- Documentation and training
- Tooling integrations
- Platform-specific implementations (web, iOS, Android)

**Goals:** Organizational efficiency, experience quality, scalability—not just visual consistency.

## Leadership Responsibilities

### Product Strategy
Treating the design system as a product:
- Define roadmap and priorities
- Balance tech debt vs new features
- Align with company strategy
- Identify adoption blockers
- Make tradeoffs explicit
- Sequence work realistically

### Systems Architecture
Design for:
- Dependencies and reuse
- Cross-platform behavior
- Long-term scalability
- Migration paths
- Interoperability

Solve for second and third-order effects, not just immediate needs.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
Key partnerships:
- Product design
- Engineering
- Accessibility
- Content
- Platform teams
- Leadership

Role includes translation between domains.

### Governance & Enablement
Define:
- What enters the system
- What stays out
- Experimental vs stable components
- Contribution processes
- Decision-making frameworks

Build:
- Documentation
- Training programs
- Office hours
- Support workflows
- Intake processes

### Quality & Craft
Focus areas:
- Interaction quality
- Motion and micro-interactions
- Accessibility
- Platform-native behavior
- Perceived performance
- UX coherence

Care about how things feel, not just how they look.

### AI & Tooling
Exploration areas:
- Design acceleration
- Handoff improvement
- Spec generation
- Workflow automation
- Machine-readable systems
- Design-to-code experiments

Includes prompt design, agent workflows, schema definition.

## Support Needs by Level

When requesting help, typically operating at one of these levels:
1. Strategic framing
2. System design
3. Program planning
4. Execution planning
5. Communication
6. Decision-making

**Default assumption:** Help needed with structure, clarity, sequencing, scope control, or making abstract concepts concrete.

**Not assumed:** UI design advice (unless explicitly requested).

## Role Boundaries

**This role is:**
- Platform-level
- System-level
- Organization-level

**This role is not:**
- Pixel-only design
- Brand-only design
- Visual-only design
