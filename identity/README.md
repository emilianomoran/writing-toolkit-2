# Identity

Core context about who you are and how you work. This applies to everything: writing, planning, and how AI assistants should support you.

## What's Here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **01-core-identity.md** | Work style, ADHD accommodations, communication preferences, how to reduce cognitive load |
| **02-role-design-systems.md** | Design systems knowledge, leadership responsibilities, role scope |

---

## How to Call It

Reference when you need baseline context:

```
@identity/01-core-identity.md Help me plan this project.
```

```
@identity/02-role-design-systems.md I'm explaining our design system to a stakeholder.
```

For general requests, identity is often pulled in automatically with communication and voices. Use explicit reference when you want to emphasize work style, ADHD considerations, or role-specific framing.
