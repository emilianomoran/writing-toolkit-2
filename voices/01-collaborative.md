## When to Use

**Use Collaborative Voice when:**
- Working with peers (no managerial relationship)
- Problem-solving together or aligning on approach
- Exploring options before deciding
- Early-stage idea exploration
- Working through tradeoffs together
- Emotional stakes are low to medium

**Don't use when:**
- Giving developmental feedback (use Coaching & Feedback)
- Setting direction or making decisions clear (use Strategic Leadership)
- Supporting well-being (use Caring Manager)
- Presenting to executives (use Presenter)
- Reviewing craft/design work (use Design Critique)

## Core Patterns

### Mid-Conversation Style
**No formal greetings or setups:**
- Jump in naturally where conversation already is
- Feels like continuing a thread, not starting a letter
- "Hey" is optional and casual, not required
- Skip "Hi," "I wanted to follow up..."

**Natural entry points:**
- "I'm thinking..." / "I'm not sure, but..."
- "What's your take on..."
- "Not sure about this part..."
- "That makes sense. What if we also..."

### Key Phrases

**State perspective:**
- "I'm thinking we prioritize spacing tokens first."
- "I'm leaning toward option B. It's faster."
- "I'm torn between A and B. Both have tradeoffs."

**Ask for input:**
- "What's your take?"
- "What are the downsides I'm not seeing?"
- "What would you prioritize?"
- "Does that make sense to you?"

**Frame as collaboration:**
- "Can we align on scope before the meeting?"
- "If we're aligned, I'll draft the timeline."
- "We could test this approach first."

### Language Tendencies

**Use "we" language:**
- "Can we..." not "Can you..."
- "We're seeing..." not "You should..."
- "Let's align..." not "I need you to..."

**Keep reasoning brief:**
- One sentence is usually enough
- "It's faster and covers 80% of use cases" not long explanations
- They can ask for more detail if needed

**Allow natural imperfection:**
- Slightly unfinished sentences are fine if natural
- "Makes sense." "Not sure about that part."
- Human > polished

## Structure

### Standard Format
1. **State your thinking** (1-2 sentences, no greeting)
2. **Explain why briefly** (1 sentence, optional)
3. **Ask for input** (1 clear question)
4. **Propose next steps** (1 sentence)

### Paragraph Rules
- One idea per paragraph
- 2-3 sentences max per paragraph
- Use line breaks to separate thoughts
- One idea per message in Slack when possible

### Example Structure

**Full message:**
"I'm thinking we prioritize spacing tokens before the grid system. It'll give us a cleaner foundation and reduce rework.

What's your take? Anything I'm missing?

If we're aligned, I'll draft a timeline by Thursday."

**Even more conversational (mid-thread):**
"Spacing tokens first makes sense. Cleaner foundation.

What's your take?"

## Voice Guidelines

### Do

**Lead with your perspective:**
- "I'm thinking we focus on buttons first." not "What do you think we should prioritize?"

**Keep explanations short:**
- One sentence of reasoning is usually enough
- "It's faster and less risky." not long paragraphs

**Ask specific questions:**
- "What's your take?" not "Thoughts?"
- "What are the downsides?" not "Any feedback?"

**Use "we" language:**
- "Can we sync before Friday?" not "Can you review this by Friday?"

**Name clear next steps:**
- "If we're aligned, I'll draft the timeline." not "Let me know your thoughts."

**Sound like a real person:**
- Write how you'd actually talk in Slack
- Conversational, not corporate

### Don't

**Avoid hierarchical language:**
- "I need you to..." → "Can we..."
- "You should..." → "What if we..."

**Avoid passive or vague phrasing:**
- "I was thinking maybe..." → "I'm thinking..."
- "It might be worth considering..." → "I'm planning to..."

**Avoid overly formal language:**
- "Per our discussion..." → "Following up on..."
- "As previously mentioned..." → Just state it directly

**Don't explain too much:**
- One reason per action
- No over-justification

**Don't ask without offering your view:**
- Lead with your thinking, then ask for input
- Don't make them do all the work

**Don't end without a next step:**
- Always close with what happens next
- "If we're aligned, I'll..." not "Let me know your thoughts."

## Examples

### Example 1: Aligning on Priorities

**Before (wrong):**
"Hi, I wanted to follow up on our discussion about component priorities. I was thinking maybe we could potentially prioritize the spacing token updates first, since they form the foundation of the system. What are your thoughts?"

**After (right):**
"Quick follow-up on component priorities. I'm thinking we do spacing tokens first. It'll reduce rework on everything else.

What's your take? Anything you'd prioritize differently?

If we're aligned, I'll draft the roadmap and share it Thursday."

---

### Example 2: Exploring Options

**Before (wrong):**
"What do you think we should do? Should we go with option A or B? What makes sense to you?"

**After (right):**
"I'm torn between option A and B. A is faster, B is more thorough. What would you prioritize?"

---

### Example 3: Proposing a Change

**Before (wrong):**
"I need you to update the component documentation to reflect the new naming convention. Please prioritize this and have it done by Friday."

**After (right):**
"Can we update the component docs to match the new naming convention? I'm thinking we do it this week so it's ready before the team training Friday.

Does that timeline work for you?"

---

### Example 4: Responding to Their Idea

**Before (wrong):**
"I don't think that approach will work. Let's stick with the original plan."

**After (right):**
"That's a good point about accessibility. I'm a bit concerned about how it scales to more complex components.

What if we kept your approach for the primary action but adjusted the secondary? Does that balance it?"

---

### Example 5: Quick Slack Check-in

**Before (wrong):**
"Hey, just wanted to check in on the component audit project. I've been working through the library and I was thinking I should focus on the active components first, but I wasn't sure if you wanted me to also document the deprecated ones. Let me know what you think!"

**After (right):**
"Component audit in progress. Focusing on active components first—will flag deprecated ones separately.

What's your take? I'll share findings Friday."

## Quick Reference

**Energy:**
- Mid-conversation, not starting a letter
- Casual teammate, not corporate policy

**Gut check:**
- Would this sound natural if I said it out loud to a teammate?
- Does this invite conversation, or shut it down?
- Am I sounding like a policy document, or a real person?
