## When to Use

**Use Strategic Leadership Voice when:**
- Announcing EGDS roadmap or priorities
- Communicating design system strategy
- Explaining why a decision was made
- Aligning stakeholders on direction
- Setting team goals or focus areas
- Making organizational decisions clear

**Don't use when:**
- Exploring options with peers (use Collaborative)
- Giving individual feedback (use Coaching & Feedback)

## Core Patterns

### Structure
1. **State the decision or direction** (clear upfront, no burying the lead)
2. **Explain the rationale** (briefly, one paragraph)
3. **Name what changes** (be specific)
4. **Set expectations** (what happens next, timeline)

### Key Phrases

**State direction:**
- "We're focusing on three areas this quarter: X, Y, Z."
- "For 2025, EGDS will focus on scalability, component quality, and cross-brand consistency."
- "We're shifting from X to Y."

**Explain rationale:**
- "Here's why: [one sentence of reasoning]."
- "The reasoning: [concise explanation]."
- "This matters because [clear impact]."

**Name changes:**
- "This means we're deprioritizing new component requests."
- "What's changing: We're moving from X to Y."
- "This means the team will focus on quality over velocity."

**Set expectations:**
- "I'll share the full roadmap by end of week."
- "Next: Complete the roadmap by end of quarter."
- "Q1: Focus on three key initiatives."

## Voice Guidelines

### Do

**Be clear and decisive:**
- "We're focusing on X." not "We might focus on X."
- "This is the priority." not "This could be a priority."
- No hedging or softening

**Use "we" language:**
- "We're focusing on..." not "I've decided that..."
- "Our priority is..." not "The team will..."
- Inclusive, not top-down

**Explain rationale briefly:**
- One paragraph, one sentence per point
- "Here's why: Scalability unlocks the remaining 20% of properties."
- Don't over-explain

**Name tradeoffs:**
- "This means we're saying no to new component requests in Q1 so we can focus on token architecture."
- Show you've thought it through

**Use structure:**
- Lists, sections, clear headers
- Short paragraphs
- Easy to scan and understand

**Connect to values:**
- "This aligns with our commitment to accessibility."
- "This reflects our belief that consistency enables speed."

### Don't

**Avoid hedging:**
- "We might..." → "We're focusing on..."
- "We're thinking about..." → "Our strategy is..."
- "Potentially, we could..." → "We're doing [clear action]."

**Avoid apologizing:**
- "Sorry, but..." → Remove "sorry"
- Stand behind decisions with confidence

**Avoid defending:**
- "Some people think..." → State the direction directly
- Don't argue with phantom critics

**Avoid vague language:**
- "We're going to try to be more strategic..." → "We're focusing on existing component quality instead of adding new components."
- Be specific about what's different

**Don't over-explain:**
- One paragraph of reasoning is enough
- Don't explain every factor that went into the decision

**Don't bury the lead:**
- Lead with the decision, not the thinking process
- "We're focusing on three priorities." not "There are several things to consider..."

## Examples

### Example 1: Setting Annual Priorities

**Before (wrong):**
"We've been thinking about our priorities, and we kind of feel like maybe we should consider focusing on some different areas. There are probably good reasons for this."

**After (right):**
"For 2025, EGDS will focus on three areas: scalability, component quality, and cross-brand consistency.

Here's why:
- Scalability: Unlocks the remaining 20% of Expedia properties
- Component quality: Reduces design debt and improves user trust
- Cross-brand consistency: Strengthens the Expedia family feel

This means we're prioritizing token architecture and reducing one-off patterns. New component requests will be evaluated against these three areas.

I'll share the full roadmap by end of week."

---

### Example 2: Announcing Quarterly Focus

**Before (wrong):**
"Things have been busy, and we've realized that maybe we should think about our priorities differently."

**After (right):**
"For Q1, we're focusing on two things: token architecture and button component refinement.

The reasoning: Token architecture is the foundation for everything else. Getting it right now saves rework later. Buttons are our highest-usage component and need consistency across brands.

What this means:
- New component requests are paused until Q2
- All design work ties back to tokens or buttons
- Documentation and quality over velocity

If you have an urgent component need, let me know and we'll evaluate it."

---

### Example 3: Explaining a Strategic Shift

**Before (wrong):**
"We might want to consider potentially exploring a different approach to how we're approaching this."

**After (right):**
"We're shifting from building new components to improving existing ones.

Here's why: We have 80% component coverage already. The bigger value is in quality, consistency, and documentation—not adding more components.

What's changing:
- New component requests will be rare
- Most work will be refinement and accessibility improvements
- Documentation becomes a priority

This makes EGDS more useful and easier to adopt."

---

### Example 4: Making a Decision Clear

**Before (wrong):**
"We're going with semantic tokens, I think. We'll see how it goes."

**After (right):**
"We're going with semantic tokens for the core system.

The rationale: Semantic tokens (button-background-primary) are easier for designers to apply correctly than abstract tokens (blue-600). This reduces errors and makes the system more intuitive.

This means:
- Token names will be descriptive and role-based
- We'll maintain a mapping to raw values in the code
- Documentation will focus on use cases, not just values

I'll update the token spec this week."

---

### Example 5: Setting Team Goals

**Before (wrong):**
"Our goal is to maybe make EGDS more useful, if possible. We'll see what happens."

**After (right):**
"Our goal for this half: Make EGDS the default choice for all new Expedia product work.

To get there, we're focusing on:
1. Component coverage for core flows (checkout, search, booking)
2. Clear documentation with real examples
3. Designer and developer onboarding

What this means for your work:
- Priority is coverage and quality, not experimental components
- Documentation is part of every component release
- We're saying no to nice-to-haves that don't serve core flows

Let's talk through specifics in our next team sync."
