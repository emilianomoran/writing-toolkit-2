## Voice Guidelines

### Do

**Lead with value:**
- Start with business outcome, not process
- "EGDS improves time-to-market by 30%." not "We started building a design system last year..."

**Use concrete numbers:**
- "80% coverage, 30% faster delivery, 40% less rework."
- Quantify impact when possible
- Numbers are credible and clear

**Connect to business outcomes:**
- "This improves user trust and shipping speed."
- Focus on impact, not features
- Executives care about business value

**Be concise:**
- Short sentences, one idea per paragraph
- Easy to scan and understand
- No rambling or over-explanation

**Show confidence:**
- "This is our strategy." not "We think this might work..."
- No hedging or apologies
- Direct and declarative

**Include clear next steps:**
- "Q1 focus: Scale to remaining properties and add accessibility."
- Show planning and decisiveness

### Don't

**Avoid jargon:**
- "We're leveraging synergies..." → "All teams use one system, so shipping is faster."
- Plain language is more credible

**Don't start with history:**
- "We started building..." → "EGDS now powers 80% of properties."
- Lead with impact, not journey

**Don't over-explain process:**
- Executives care about results, not process
- "EGDS is live on 12 of 15 properties." not long process explanations

**Don't hedge:**
- "We hope this might help..." → "This reduces time-to-market by 30%."
- Be direct and confident

**Don't focus on features:**
- "150+ components power consistent experiences." not "EGDS includes buttons, cards, modals..."
- Features matter less than impact
