**Document Type:** Voice Mode Guide  
**Priority:** High  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05

Genuine, direct communication with leaders and executives. Clear and respectful of their time, without performing or polishing.

## When to Use

**Use Leader Conversation Voice when:**
- Updating your manager, director, or VP on progress or blockers
- Running an idea or decision by a leader before moving forward
- Briefing an exec who needs the real picture (not a deck)
- Asking for input or alignment from someone senior
- Writing to leaders in a way that sounds like you, not like a memo

**Don't use when:**
- Talking to peers (use Collaborative)
- Announcing direction to your team or stakeholders (use Strategic Leadership)
- Formal presentation or pitch with slides (use Presenter)
- Giving feedback to a report (use Coaching & Feedback)

## Core Patterns

### The Difference

- **Strategic Leadership** = You're the one setting direction. You're announcing, deciding, aligning others.
- **Leader Conversation** = You're talking to someone who sets direction. You're updating, briefing, or asking. Same clarity, different power dynamic. No performance.

### Structure

1. **Lead with the point** (what they need to know or what you need from them)
2. **Brief context** (one or two sentences, only if needed)
3. **Your take or ask** (what you're thinking or what you need)
4. **Next steps** (if relevant)

### Key Phrases

**Lead with the update:**
- "Quick update: We're on track for X. One blocker: Y."
- "Wanted to run this by you before we commit."
- "Here's where things stand on the token rollout."

**State your thinking:**
- "I'm leaning toward X because..."
- "My read is we should... What's your take?"
- "I'm not sure we need to do Y. Here's why."

**Ask for input:**
- "Does that direction work for you?"
- "Anything you'd prioritize differently?"
- "Want to discuss before I share with the team?"

**Respect their time:**
- "In short: ..."
- "Bottom line: ..."
- "The one thing I need from you: ..."

### Language Tendencies

**Be direct:**
- Say what you mean. No throat-clearing.
- "We're behind" not "We're experiencing some delays"
- "I need your call on this" not "I was hoping we might be able to get your input"

**Stay conversational:**
- Write how you'd say it in a 1:1 or a short email
- Contractions are fine. Short sentences are fine.
- You're not writing a press release

**No impressing:**
- Skip the metric-stuffing unless it's directly relevant
- Skip "positioning" and "strategic implications" unless they asked
- Skip corporate filler ("leverage," "align," "circle back" as decoration)

**One level of detail:**
- Give enough that they can respond. Don't over-explain.
- If they want more, they'll ask.

## Voice Guidelines

### Do

**Lead with what matters:**
- First sentence = the point. Not the background.
- "We need to push the token launch to March. Dependency on Brand is blocking us."

**Be clear about the ask:**
- If you need something, say it. "I need your sign-off by Friday." "Can you weigh in on A vs B?"

**Sound like yourself:**
- If you'd say it in person, it's fine to write it.
- "My read is..." "I'm not sure about..." "Wanted to flag this."

**Name tradeoffs when relevant:**
- Shows you've thought it through. "Option A is faster but riskier. Option B is slower but cleaner."

**Keep it scannable:**
- Short paragraphs. Bullets when there's a list. They're busy.

### Don't

**Don't perform:**
- No "This positions EGDS to enable..." unless that's actually the point
- No stacking metrics to look good
- No pitch language when you're just updating

**Don't over-formalize:**
- "Per our discussion" → "Following up on our conversation" or just state the thing
- "I wanted to reach out regarding" → "Quick update on" or "Wanted to run this by you"

**Don't bury the lead:**
- If you need a decision, say that first. Then context.
- If you're blocked, say that first. Then why.

**Don't hedge so much it's vague:**
- "I'm thinking we might want to consider possibly..." → "I'm leaning toward X. What's your take?"
- You can still ask for input without sounding unsure of yourself

**Don't over-explain:**
- One or two sentences of context is usually enough
- They can ask for more

## Examples

### Example 1: Updating Your Manager on a Blocker

**Before (wrong):**
"I wanted to reach out to provide an update on the EGDS token initiative. We've been making progress in a number of areas, but there are some dependencies that we're tracking. I wanted to make sure you were aware of the situation."

**After (right):**
"Quick update on the token rollout: We're blocked on Brand's color system. They're two weeks behind, and we can't finalize semantic tokens until we have their primaries.

Options: We wait and push our launch to March, or we lock our tokens to the current palette and refactor when Brand ships. I'm leaning toward waiting so we don't do the work twice. What's your call?"

---

### Example 2: Running a Decision By a Director

**Before (wrong):**
"Hi, I've been thinking about our approach to the component audit and wanted to get your thoughts on potentially shifting our priorities to focus on the most widely used components first. I believe this could have positive implications for the team's efficiency."

**After (right):**
"Wanted to run this by you before we lock the audit plan. I'm thinking we prioritize the top 20 components by usage instead of doing the full library in order. We'd get impact faster and could expand later.

Downside: Some teams use the long tail. We could document those on request. Does that direction work for you?"

---

### Example 3: Brief Email to VP

**Before (wrong):**
"I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take the opportunity to provide a high-level overview of our design system initiatives and the strategic value we're delivering across the organization. Our focus areas include scalability, quality, and consistency, and we're seeing strong traction."

**After (right):**
"Here's where EGDS stands: We're live on 80% of properties. Q1 focus is token architecture and button consistency. One risk: we're under-resourced for the documentation push we promised. I'm going to propose a scope trim so we hit what we committed. I'll share the proposal by Thursday."

---

### Example 4: Asking for Input

**Before (wrong):**
"I was wondering if you might have a few moments to share your perspective on the prioritization of our roadmap items. Your strategic input would be valuable as we finalize our plans."

**After (right):**
"I've got the draft roadmap. Before I share it with the team, I'd like your input on one thing: I have token architecture and accessibility as the top two priorities. Anything you'd prioritize differently?"

---

### Example 5: Flagging a Risk

**Before (wrong):**
"I wanted to bring to your attention that there may be some potential challenges with the timeline that we're monitoring closely. I'll keep you updated as the situation develops."

**After (right):**
"Flagging a risk: The Brand dependency might slip our token launch to March. I'll know more after we sync with them on Thursday. If it slips, I'll adjust the rest of the roadmap and share an updated timeline."

## Quick Reference

**Structure:**
1. Lead with the point (update, ask, or risk)
2. Brief context (1–2 sentences)
3. Your take or what you need
4. Next steps if relevant

**Tone:**
- Direct and conversational
- Respectful of their time, not their title
- You're briefing, not pitching
- Human, not corporate

**Language:**
- "Quick update:" / "Wanted to run this by you" / "Here's where things stand"
- "My read is..." / "I'm leaning toward..." / "What's your call?"
- Short sentences. No filler.

**Avoid:**
- Performing (metric-stuffing, positioning language)
- Over-formal ("I wanted to reach out regarding")
- Burying the lead
- Hedging into vagueness

**Gut check:**
- Would I say this in a 1:1?
- Did I lead with what they need to know?
- Does this sound like me, or like I'm trying to impress?
- If they only read the first sentence, would they get the point?
