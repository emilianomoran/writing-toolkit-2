## Decision Tree

Start with these questions:

### 1. Who is your audience?
- **Peer/teammate?** → Likely Collaborative
- **Direct report?** → Likely Coaching & Feedback or Caring Manager
- **Broader team/stakeholders?** → Likely Strategic Leadership
- **Designer for craft feedback?** → Likely Design Critique
- **Leader/executive (updating, briefing, asking)?** → Likely Leader Conversation
- **Executive/customer (presenting, pitching)?** → Likely Presenter

### 2. What's your goal?
- **Align, explore, solve together?** → Collaborative
- **Grow skills, course-correct?** → Coaching & Feedback
- **Support well-being, reduce pressure?** → Caring Manager
- **Set direction, make decisions clear?** → Strategic Leadership
- **Elevate craft, improve design?** → Design Critique
- **Update a leader, run something by them, brief without performing?** → Leader Conversation
- **Communicate value, gain buy-in (formal pitch/presentation)?** → Presenter

### 3. What are the emotional stakes?
- **Low:** Collaborative, Design Critique, Presenter
- **Medium:** Coaching & Feedback, Strategic Leadership
- **High:** Caring Manager

## Mode Descriptions

### Collaborative
**Use when:** Working with peers to solve problems, align on approach, or explore options together.

**Signals:** Peer relationship, problem-solving together, open exploration, "What do you think?" energy.

**File:** `01-collaborative.md`

---

### Design Critique
**Use when:** Reviewing UX flows, evaluating component designs, giving craft feedback, assessing accessibility.

**Signals:** Craft leadership role, specific design work to review, quality and standards matter, analytical + supportive tone.

**File:** `02-design-critique.md`

---

### Strategic Leadership
**Use when:** Announcing EGDS roadmap, explaining decisions, aligning stakeholders, setting team goals, communicating organizational changes.

**Signals:** Leadership → team/stakeholders, direction-setting intent, need for clarity and decisiveness, strategic thinking required.

**File:** `03-strategic-leadership.md`

---

### Leader Conversation
**Use when:** Updating your manager/director/VP, running an idea by a leader, briefing an exec who needs the real picture (not a deck), asking for input from someone senior.

**Signals:** Upward or lateral-to-senior audience, you're updating or asking (not announcing direction), want to sound like yourself without performing, clear and respectful of their time.

**File:** `05-leader-conversation.md`

---

### Presenter
**Use when:** Presenting to executives, pitching to customers, summarizing strategic initiatives, high-stakes visibility.

**Signals:** Executive or external audience, high-level strategic communication, need for crispness and efficiency, professional but human.

**File:** `04-presenter.md`

---

### Coaching & Feedback
**Use when:** Writing performance reviews, addressing missed deadlines, clarifying expectations, following up on feedback, coaching through growth areas.

**Signals:** Manager → direct report relationship, developmental intent, clear behavior to address, growth opportunity exists.

**Note:** Optimized file not yet created. Use Collaborative patterns with directness about behavior.

---

### Caring Manager
**Use when:** Supporting someone who's overwhelmed, stressed, or dealing with personal challenges, building psychological safety, check-ins about well-being.

**Signals:** High emotional stakes, well-being is the priority, need for patience and warmth, low-pressure language.

**Note:** Optimized file not yet created. Use Collaborative patterns with emphasis on support and well-being.

---

## Hybrid Situations

Sometimes you need elements of multiple modes:

### Coaching + Caring Manager
**Situation:** Giving feedback to someone who's also struggling personally.

**Approach:** Lead with Caring Manager (acknowledge well-being), then shift to Coaching (name behavior clearly but gently).

**Example:**
"I know the last few weeks have been tough. Let's make sure you have what you need.

Separately, I noticed the component spec was incomplete. This created confusion for the dev team. Let's talk about how to flag these earlier so we can support you differently."

---

### Collaborative + Strategic Leadership
**Situation:** Exploring options with peers while also making a decision clear.

**Approach:** Start Collaborative (explore together), then shift to Strategic Leadership (land the decision).

**Example:**
"I'm thinking we prioritize token architecture over new components this quarter. What are the downsides I'm not seeing? [collaborative exploration]

After hearing your input: We're going with token architecture. Here's why and what changes."

---

### Design Critique + Collaborative
**Situation:** Giving craft feedback to a peer (not a report).

**Approach:** Use Design Critique voice patterns but soften hierarchy with Collaborative framing.

**Example:**
"I'm seeing a few things we could tighten up. The hover state feels subtle—let's test with higher contrast. And the spacing in the header is a bit uneven. Want to pair on it?"

---

## Edge Cases

### "I'm not sure what the emotional stakes are"
Default to Collaborative or Strategic Leadership. If in doubt, start Collaborative (safer, more open) and adjust based on response.

---

### "The audience is mixed (peers + reports + stakeholders)"
Choose the mode based on **primary intent**, not audience composition:
- If the goal is alignment → Collaborative
- If the goal is direction-setting → Strategic Leadership

---

### "I need to be direct but also warm"
That's most modes! The key differences:
- **Coaching & Feedback:** Direct about behavior, warm in support
- **Caring Manager:** Warm first, problem-solving second
- **Strategic Leadership:** Direct about decisions, warm in tone
- **Collaborative:** Warm curiosity without directness

Match your primary goal.

---

### "This is a performance review but the person is also struggling"
Write two sections:
1. Performance review in **Coaching & Feedback** mode
2. Well-being check-in in **Caring Manager** mode

Keep them separate so each gets the right tone.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Presenter Mode with Your Team
**Problem:** Your team doesn't need executive-level polish. They need clarity and connection.

**Fix:** Use Strategic Leadership or Collaborative instead.

---

### Mistake 2: Using Presenter When You're Just Updating a Leader
**Problem:** Presenter is for formal presentations and pitches. If you're updating your VP or running something by your director, you don't need to perform.

**Fix:** Use Leader Conversation. Be clear and direct. Sound like yourself. No metric-stuffing or positioning language.

---

### Mistake 3: Using Collaborative Mode for Feedback
**Problem:** Feedback needs directness. Collaborative is exploratory and can feel vague.

**Fix:** Use Coaching & Feedback. Be clear, kind, and specific.

---

### Mistake 4: Using Strategic Leadership for Well-being Conversations
**Problem:** Well-being needs warmth and patience, not decisiveness.

**Fix:** Use Caring Manager. Slow down and prioritize the person.

---

### Mistake 5: Using Caring Manager for Performance Issues
**Problem:** Over-softening feedback creates ambiguity.

**Fix:** Use Coaching & Feedback. Name the issue clearly, then offer support.

---

### Mistake 6: Mixing Modes Mid-Message
**Problem:** Shifting tone within a single message creates confusion.

**Fix:** Choose one primary mode per message. If you need multiple tones, write separate sections with clear transitions.

## For AI Agents: Step-by-Step Selection

1. **Read the user's request and identify:**
   - Who is the audience? (peer, report, stakeholder, executive, customer)
   - What is the goal? (align, coach, support, direct, critique, present)
   - What are the emotional stakes? (low, medium, high)

2. **Map to a mode using the decision tree above**

3. **Load that mode's file:**
   - Read the optimized voice file (01-04)
   - Follow all voice patterns
   - Avoid all "don'ts"
   - Reference examples for style

4. **Write strictly in that mode**

5. **If the situation is hybrid:**
   - Choose the primary mode based on main intent
   - Add elements of secondary mode only if needed
   - Keep transitions clear

## Still Unsure?

If you're stuck between modes, ask:

**"What's the single most important thing I need to accomplish here?"**

- Align or explore? → Collaborative
- Grow or course-correct? → Coaching & Feedback
- Support or reduce pressure? → Caring Manager
- Decide or direct? → Strategic Leadership
- Elevate craft? → Design Critique
- Update or brief a leader (genuine, not pitch)? → Leader Conversation
- Communicate value (formal pitch/presentation)? → Presenter

The answer will point you to the right mode.
